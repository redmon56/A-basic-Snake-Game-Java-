# A-basic-Snake-Game-Java-
--This is my attempt at making the game Snake without any outside help (i.e. No tutorials, No Forum Questions, etc.). I am aware that it could be more efficient and that there is a bit of lag.    

--The game uses a LinkedList structure for the Snake, a 2D byte array for the game board, and a Thread for the game update system.  

--If you choose to give it a try, then the key bindings are: 
  Up Arrow OR W_Key -- Up
  Down Arrow OR S_Key -- Down
  Right Arrow OR D_Key -- Right
  Left Arrow OR A_Key -- Left
  Space Bar -- Pause Game
  
--As a final note, be aware that there are bound to be a few errors here and there while playing.
